# Tallessa – Effortless Asset Management

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tallessa/tallessa-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tallessa/tallessa-frontend) -->

## Responsive Web Frontend

## Requirements

* Node.js 6.x

## Getting started

    git clone git@github.com:tallessa/tallessa-frontend
    cd tallessa-frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    iexplore http://localhost:8080

## Coding conventions

Coding conventions are enforced via `eslint`. We deviate from [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) in the following points:

* Contents of a single line object literal are not space-wrapped: `{foo: 5}`
* It's OK to define multiple `let`s or `const`s in a single statement as long as you indent this way:

    const
      a = 5,
      b = 6;
